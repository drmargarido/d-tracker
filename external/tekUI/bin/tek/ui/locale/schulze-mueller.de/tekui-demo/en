» The scaling and colorization of vector graphics is adaptive to the screen palette and element size. 

» Stock images can be overlaid with bitmaps (or other vector graphics), but vector graphics are normally more resource-friendly than bitmaps.

» If the upper bitmaps icon shows the flags of Spain and Italy, then PNG support is enabled. Otherwise, only the built-in PPM format is supported. If the image background spans the whole element and is not white, then the display driver supports alpha channel. If the element's background is a blue gradient, you have gradient support enabled in tekUI.
